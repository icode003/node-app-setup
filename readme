# Node.js CRUD API with EJS and MongoDB

A simple Node.js application demonstrating CRUD operations with **MongoDB** and **EJS templates**. The application allows users to list items, delete and it allows blogs to list blog, edit blog, delete blog them via a confirmation modal, and interact with a MongoDB database.

## Description

This is a Node.js application built to perform basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on items stored in a **MongoDB** database. It uses **Express** as the web framework, **Mongoose** to interact with MongoDB, and **EJS** as the templating engine for rendering views. A confirmation popup is used before deleting any items.
